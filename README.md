## WikiReading Data

Train, validation, and test datasets are in [TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/how_tos/reading_data/index.html#file-formats)
or streamed JSON (one JSON object per line).
For example test.tar.gz contains 15 files whose union is the whole test set.
We split them to help speed up training/testing by parallelizing reads.
Any one of the shards can be opened with a [TFRecordReader](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/io_ops.html#TFRecordReader)
or with your favorite JSON reader for every line.

of the training set to play around with if disk space is limited.
